## Problem 1
- Scenario: Grading
- Assumptions:
  - I do not have enough time to grade all 200+ students' homework, so I will have several TAs to help me.
  - The type of the homework is a C++ project, which will be saved on a server. Grader need to check the correctness of the program and quality of the code.
  - The server which the homework is committed to can be considered absolutely safe.
- Assets:
  - The integrity of the grades, only my TAs and me can make or change the students' grades.
  - The confidentiality of the homeworks. The homeworks can not be seen by students who will take the course in the future.
  - The integrity of the homeworks. The homeworks should be read only.
  - The computers which the students' projects will run on. The homeworks are needed to be compiled and executed to check their correctness, so they are able to undermine the computers.
  - The availability of the homework. I need to save the homework until the end of the course just in case that some students will argue the grades.
- Threats:
  - The students have a motivation to change their grades by hacking or wrecking my TAs' or my computers, bribing my TAs, and changing their submitted homework.
  - My TAs may sell the homework to the students who will take the course in the future.
  - Some evil students may want to do something bad on my computer with their executable homework.
  - Natural disasters like earthquake and fire.
- Countermeasures:
  - To protect the homeworks' integrity and availability I will make backup of them and make the homeworks read only by only give my TA the read permission of the server.
  - I can prevent my TAs make copies of the by only permit TAs do the work in my office. But it may be too strict for my TAs, an alternative way is to set limitation of TAs' work time, which make TAs have no time copy.
  - To prevent that some of my TAs are bribed I will make a homework be graded by two TAs, which will increase the cost of bribing.
  - I will set up virtual enviroments for the homework to run on to avoid possible damage to my computer.
  - The grades are also saved on the server which is considered completely safe and I will make the grade read only after my TAs and I finish our work. Thus I have no worry about the integrity of the homeworks and the grades.
  - For natural disasters it is obviously overthinking to consider them.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: Stadium
- Assumptions:
  - The stadium can be used by the football team or other students.
  - The football team will use this stadium both for training and match, so the stadium is used frequantly.
  - The stadium is so large that it is not possible to totally prevent people to sneak in.
- Assets:
  - The equipments of the stadium, some of which are necessary for the game some of which are necessary for the audience.
  - The equipments of the team which will be used by the athletes during the game.
  - The athletes' personal safety.
  - The audienceâ€˜s safety.
  - The match which is held in this stadium should not be disturbed easily.
- Threats:
  - Thiefs may break into the dresser room to steal valuable things.
  - Terrorists may want to massacre when there are a lot of people in the stadium.
  - The opponents of the team may want to win the game by destroying the team's equipments.
  - Crazy fans from both teams may want to stop the game or hurt each other during the game.
- Countermeasures:
  - There are three different states of the stadium: match, training and free. I also have three different levels of security for each of the states: 
    1. During the match I will hire extra security staff, use metal detector and turn on all the monitors.
    2. When the stadium is used for training I will only use monitors for security.
    3. When the stadium is free I will turn off some monitors.
  - To make the game undisturbable, I will seperate fans of different team and employ security staffs to prevent unrelated people enter the field. Check both the equipments of the stadium and of the athletes before the game. Some important equipments should have a spare one. 
  - For some expensive equipments of the stadium I will use suitable insurance.
  - The doors/gates of the stadium also have different levels of security, the ascend order is: the door of the locker, the gates of the stadium, the door of athletes' dresser room. The lockers of the doors should be different types.

## Problem 3
- Scenario: When I study in library I often leave my computer on my seat and go to drink water or use the restroom. How can I keep my computer safe while I was away?
- Assumptions:
  - I will leave my seat for at most 5 minutes.
  - My computer has a password that is unhackable.
- Assets:
  - The physical safty of my computer, which means it should be uneasy or costy to steal it or destroy it.
  - The software safty of my computer, which means people cannot get the files from my computer or input information into my computer.
- Threats:
  - Thiefs may want to steal my computer for money.
  - Bad guys may want to kidnap my computer by install virus on it.
  - Voyeur may want to obtain files in my computer.
  - Accidents like fallen cup may damage my computer.
- Countermeasures:
  - One totally safe way is to bring my computer with me all the time. But it is obviously too inconvinient or costy to do this.
  - To make myself always be able to hold someone accountable, I can always choose a seat under the watch of a monitor.
  - There are three ways to protect both the physical and software safty of my computer. I consider they have the same security level but have different limitation. In other words they can take place of others. If I use these three ways alternatively I can have a good method whose limitation is lower than any of the three.
    1. I can use the room on the 6th floor of our Fondren library. The room has an independent security door, I can have a private table and the restroom is very near. The disadvantage is the position is limited.
    2. I can also use the study room which is very safe because I have a private room with locker and keys, the disadvantage is that I can only use 4 hours a day and the room is also limited and should be reserved.
    3. I can keep myself companied by my friends, but my friends will not always have the same schedule of me.
  - I consider that the accidents are numerous and unpredictable, it will cost too much to totally avoid all accidents. I will only make effort to avoid obvious accident like never put the cup near my computer.
