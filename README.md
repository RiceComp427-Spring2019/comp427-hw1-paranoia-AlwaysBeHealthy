## Problem 1
- Scenario: Grading
- Assumptions:
  - I do not have enough time to grade all 200+ students' homework, so I will have several TAs to help me.
  - The type of the homework is a C++ project, grader need to check the correctness of the program and quality of the code.
- Assets:
  - The integrity of the grades, only my TAs and me can make or change the students' grades.
  - The confidentiality of the homeworks. The homeworks can not be seen by students who will take the course in the future.
  - The integrity of the homeworks. The homeworks should be read only.
  - The computers which the students' projects will run on. The homeworks are needed to be compiled and executed to check their correctness, so they are able to undermine the computers.
  - The availability of the homework. I need to save the homework until the end of the course just in case that some students will argue the grades.
  - The genuineness of the grades. Every student's homework should be graded fairly.
- Threats:
  - The students have a motivation to change their grades by hacking or wrecking my TAs' or my computer, bribing my TAs, and changing their submitted homework.
  - My TAs may make high grade for the ones they love or low grade for the ones they hate.
  - My TAs may sell the homework to the students who will take the course in the future.
  - Some evil students may want to do something bad on my computer with their executable homework.
  - Natural disasters like earthquake and fire.
